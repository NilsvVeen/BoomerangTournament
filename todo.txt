- include restrictions for seeding | ✅Done: use seeding + swaps
- include file paths for build
- load/save for everything
- make tabs different ✅Done: now subtabs
- clean up code and put in different files
- make GUI fancy ✅Done: tempalte
- if group small, add people to other groups
- allow users to be swapped to a different group?
- include tournament name field ✅Done: slug for website
- when filling in one event. then add new events and fill in score, it won't reflect to the total points page and throw an error. Consider restricting the order!
- include linking to website ✅Done; needs a username, password to wordpress
- add shuffling in final circles 
- fast catch scores.

Tab throwers list

1) Removing Restriction when there ist no restriction: throws index out of range exception:  ✅Done: added check if at least one restriction

 File "C:\Users\Manuel\Desktop\BoomerangTournament-main\BoomerangTournament-main\Main.py", line 518, in remove_restriction
    group_tag = tree.item(selected_item)["tags"][0]
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^
IndexError: string index out of range

2) Sometimes, when deleting the lowest thrower and then restrict the two last throwers, I get an error:        ✘ NOT DONE: Haven't been able to replicate this. I don't get the error, but when you remove one then load again, the couple will stay but it misses the throwres. do a check before. i.e.  https://gyazo.com/75e558ac44516a077ab301f8c6663a84

after restarting main.py it works again.
So probably an index is not updated afterdeleting a thrower?

3) When I restrict two throwers, then delete one of the restricted throwers I get an index out of range again.        ✘ NOT DONE: Haven't been able to replicate this
File "C:\Users\Manuel\Desktop\BoomerangTournament-main\BoomerangTournament-main\Main.py", line 518, in remove_restriction

Tab event order

I created the score tabs, then entered np,d and -1 as Accuracy score. -1 resulted in -1000 points. Probably best is to restrict the possible scores to positive or zero values for numbers? ✅Done: clamp negatives to >=0

I hit "create score tabs" a second time and it created an additional complete list of scoring tabs. What a mess :-). No option to undo.  ✅Done: keep track of added events.
Maybe better create the score tabs one event after another?

Move up/move down an event afterwards doesn't update the order of the created scoretabs. Would be nice. ✘ NOT DONE: Fix that later

Removing a selected event doesn't delete the according scoretab which it should I think. ✘ NOT DONE: Fix that later

Nice to have in the scoretabs would be: Display the points (relative or position based). That would require an possibility to choose the official scoring system. ✘ NOT DONE: Add in later version

Total ranking is missing if I don't save the scores. That's planned I guess. ✘ NOT DONE: But don't think it should be changed. ✅Done

I'm confused about the Group Generator(but that's not a "real thing" according to your description). That's supposed to be used only before the first event? When completing an event I can do "next event grouping" but haven't got the possibility to change the group size. ✅Done: Removed this all together.

Order within group: Usually, the best throwers compete last, not first. ✅Done: Reverse groups and internally too

By "Group" you probably mean "circle"? The number of circles may change from event to event. ✅Done

My basic idea was:   ✘ Mostly done. Needs an update. Look at current algorithm if thats sufficient
1. ‎How many circles are in use? Let's say 3 ✅Done
2. How many throwers? Lets say 23 ✅Done
3. Then we have 3x7+2 (split in two halves foreach circle).
4. Distribute the throwers according to their rank as

circle x    
15
14
13
4
3
2
1


circle y
19
18
17
16
8
7
6
5

circle z
23
22
21
20
12
11
10
9

Of course rotate the circle number where the "top group"  is  from event to event. That's why I noted x y z
