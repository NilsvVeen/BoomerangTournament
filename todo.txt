- include restrictions for seeding | ✅Done: use seeding + swaps
- include file paths for build
- load/save for everything
- make tabs different
- clean up code and put in different files
- make GUI fancy
- if group small, add people to other groups
- allow users to be swapped to a different group?
- include tournament name field

Tab throwers list

1) Removing Restriction when there ist no restriction: throws index out of range exception:

 File "C:\Users\Manuel\Desktop\BoomerangTournament-main\BoomerangTournament-main\Main.py", line 518, in remove_restriction
    group_tag = tree.item(selected_item)["tags"][0]
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^
IndexError: string index out of range

2) Sometimes, when deleting the lowest thrower and then restrict the two last throwers, I get an error:
  File "C:\Users\Manuel\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Lib\tkinter\ttk.py", line 288, in _val_or_dict
    res = tk.call(*(args + options))
_tkinter.TclError: Item I04E not found

after restarting main.py it works again.
So probably an index is not updated afterdeleting a thrower?

3) When I restrict two throwers, then delete one of the restricted throwers I get an index out of range again. 
File "C:\Users\Manuel\Desktop\BoomerangTournament-main\BoomerangTournament-main\Main.py", line 518, in remove_restriction
    group_tag = tree.item(selected_item)["tags"][0]
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^
IndexError: string index out of range

Tab event order

I created the score tabs, then entered np,d and -1 as Accuracy score. -1 resulted in -1000 points. Probably best is to restrict the possible scores to positive or zero values for numbers?

I hit "create score tabs" a second time and it created an additional complete list of scoring tabs. What a mess :-). No option to undo.
Maybe better create the score tabs one event after another?

Move up/move down an event afterwards doesn't update the order of the created scoretabs. Would be nice.

Removing a selected event doesn't delete the according scoretab which it should I think.

Nice to have in the scoretabs would be: Display the points (relative or position based). That would require an possibility to choose the official scoring system.

Total ranking is missing if I don't save the scores. That's planned I guess.

I'm confused about the Group Generator(but that's not a "real thing" according to your description). That's supposed to be used only before the first event? When completing an event I can do "next event grouping" but haven't got the possibility to change the group size.

Order within group: Usually, the best throwers compete last, not first.

By "Group" you probably mean "circle"? The number of circles may change from event to event.

My basic idea was:
1. ‎How many circles are in use? Let's say 3
2. How many throwers? Lets say 23
3. Then we have 3x7+2 (split in two halves foreach circle).
4. Distribute the throwers according to their rank as

circle x    
15
14
13
4
3
2
1


circle y
19
18
17
16
8
7
6
5

circle z
23
22
21
20
12
11
10
9

Of course rotate the circle number where the "top group"  is  from event to event. That's why I noted x y z
